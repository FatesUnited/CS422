CS 422 Project Focus Group Notes:
Design Overview:
-The application will show the graph data for different states and years and also have split information based upon the type of vehicle involved in the crash.

-There will be a map of the United States on the screen (which will be split into 4 regions: BASED ON TIMEZONES) and it will show a dot where your standing with respect to the map.
	-There will also be a map of the U.S. on the ground for the the user to know what to do.

-The user will wave their hand (or say "select" or "view") and the user will be zoomed into that region in which the user can then choose a state to get data for by either swiping through states or saying the states name.

-You could change vehicle type by saying the type of vehicle
	-Some sort of motion to swipe between types of vehicles.

-You could change the year by saying the year you would like to change to.
	-Some sort of motion to swipe between years

-There two different types of data to view:
	-Number of fatalaties
	-Number of cars involved in fatalities

Questions to ask during focus group:
1. Is anything unclear or hard to understand about the visualization design?
2. What do you like about the visualization design? Is it engaging? Why or why not?
3. Is anything unclear or hard to understand about the interaction design?
4. What do you like about the interaction design? Is it engaging? Why or why not?
5. What type of data would you rather see fatalities or number of cars involved in fatalities?
6. Would you like to hear car crash sound effects while looking at fatalities statistics?
