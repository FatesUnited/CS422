Below are the notes I took from the focus group discussion on Monday 2014-02-24:

CS 422 Focus Group 7 Notes:
------------------------------------------------------

Default to most recent year if something isn't picked.

Information retreival...
	Separate everything by "state".
	Get rid of other...?

Flow... separate into state (by text file), by year, by car type, by fatalities.
[The above is for data extraction from Excel.]

How do we switch states? What do we cancel with? Stepping back? Etc.?

Discussed different ideas on how to select data type group (year, car type) (with images?)

Images of vehicle types for selection help.
